# Credit Approval, Default Prediction and Fraud Detection using Stacked Learning


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ReadMe File for Code Execution:

1. All 3 datasets have been evaluated separately in their corresponding Jupyter Notebooks.
2. To view a Use case, open notebook and run cell by cell.
3. Running all the cells at once WILL hang your computer as heavy algorithms were used.
4. Summary of the analysis is given in the attached Project Report.
5. Some extra output files may get created while execution but will not impact the process.
6. Datasets can be found in the links for reproducibility of outputs: [Credit Approval Data](https://www.kaggle.com/rikdifos/credit-card-approvalprediction), [Credit Default Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients), [Fraud Detection Data](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
7. Links for datasets in public domain are also attached in the Project report for reference.
8. Presentation provides the steps taken for analysis in brief and concludes the Project submission.


NOTE: Running certain cells with comments as 'Too computationally intensive' is not 
recommended for quick review.
